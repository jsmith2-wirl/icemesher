# icemesher
This is a series of functions and code snippets that will create a 3-D iceberg mesh with rams of various orientations and sizes from a 2-D spatial polygon. These tools will also help the user predict buoyancy-induced stresses in the iceberg via the FEA software package LS DYNA (the user should already have a license for this software).
